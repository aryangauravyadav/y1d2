      <h2>What's the point of making good decisions?</h2>
      <time>Dec 21, 2022</time>
      <p>
        <span class="drop-cap">A</span>t times I am in the spirit of trying to understand my intuitions. What
        follows is me complicating an answer to a simple question.
      </p>
      <p>
        'What's the point of making good decisions?'. My intuitive response is,
        'if you make good decisions, you'll end up with good outcomes'. There
        are, of course, situations where making good decisions doesn't lead you
        to good outcomes. But for the most part, I think my intuitive response
        works, and I shall try to back it up.
      </p>
      <p>i. Bertha</p>
      <p>
        Bertha is incandescent about her one goal in life; she wants to write
        10,000 words every day! Every second spent not writing is a second
        Bertha thinks is wasted. Decisions like what to eat or wear have become
        inconsequential (or, at the very least, an afterthought) to her.
      </p>
      <p>
        One morning, Bertha wakes up to grey clouds outside her bedroom window.
        She pays little attention to it and gets on with her day. As Bertha
        leaves her apartment, she tries to call for a taxi to take her to the
        library. To her chagrin, none show up, so Bertha decides to walk
        instead. Lo and behold, five minutes in, raindrops from the grey clouds
        start trickling down on her; Bertha realises she left her umbrella at
        home. She could go back to her apartment but chooses not to. She thought
        the droplets were merely signs of a drizzle, and she was in no mood to
        waste any more time. Alas, Bertha was wrong; heavy showers began pouring
        on her.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, poor Bertha catches a fever because of the rain, which
        leaves her unable to write.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's say we bring in a group of people to assess what happened to
        Bertha and get a 50:50 split between them. On one side, let's call them
        the <em>'serves her right'</em> group, thinks Bertha had this coming to
        her. On the other side, we have the <em>'not to blame'</em> group who
        argue that what happened to Bertha wasn't her fault because she couldn't
        have foreseen all the events that unfolded.
      </p>
      <p>ii. <strong>'Serves her right'</strong></p>
      <p>What do the arguments for this side look like?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>A1</strong> - Bertha is too caught up in her aspiration to write
        down 10,000 words every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A2</strong> - Instead, she should pay more attention to the
        world around her.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>C1</strong> - If she had paid more attention to the world, she
        wouldn't have caught a fever.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>C2</strong> - Bertha got what was coming to her. This serves her
        right.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">A1 + A2 = C1</p>
      <p style="text-align: center">C1 → C2</p>
      <p>
        C1 seems to reason along the same lines as my earlier intuition; good
        decisions lead to good outcomes. Paying more attention to the world (a
        good decision) would have prevented her from getting a fever (good
        outcome).
      </p>
      <p><em>So, is C1 correct?</em></p>
      <p>What were some things that happened in Bertha's world?</p>
      <p>
        W1 - Bertha woke up to grey clouds in the sky.<br />
        W2 - A taxi didn't arrive, so Bertha walked to the library.<br />
        W3 - Raindrops started to fall five minutes into her walk.<br />
        W4 - Heavy showers began eventually.<br />
        W5 (the bad outcome) - Bertha catches a fever<sup
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref-1"
          ><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup
        >.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        From W1 to W4, Bertha could have acted differently to prevent W5 from
        happening. For example:
      </p>
      <p>W1 → G1<br /></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          If Bertha noticed the clouds instead of rushing into her day, she
          might have checked the weather forecast or carried an umbrella before
          leaving her apartment.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>W2 → G2<br /></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Bertha could have gone back up to her apartment and grabbed her
          umbrella before she decided to walk.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        So, if Bertha had made good decisions like G1 or G2, she could have
        avoided W5. So arguably, it's reasonable to say that C1 is correct.
      </p>
      <p><em>So then, what's the takeaway if C1 is right?</em></p>
      <p>
        If C1 is correct, you have an answer to what the point of making good
        decisions is. If you want a good outcome, like, being able to write
        10,000 words every day, then making good decisions that lead you to it
        is instrumentally valuable.
      </p>
      <p>iii. <strong>'Not to blame'</strong></p>
      <p>What do the arguments for this side look like?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>A1</strong> - Bertha might have been too caught up in her
        aspiration of writing 10,000 words every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A2</strong> - But she could not have possibly foreseen
        everything that happened to her that day.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>D1</strong> - Since Bertha couldn't have foreseen her getting a
        fever from events W1 to W4, it would be wrong to blame her.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">A1 + A2 = D1</p>
      <p>
        <em>Prima facie</em>, D1 seems to serve as a rebuttal to C1, but I don't
        think this is right. D1 adds nuance to C1.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is plausible that Bertha couldn't have foreseen that a taxi would not
        arrive when she called for one (W2). Of course, much like Bertha, we all
        deal with uncertainty all the time and no decision we take is done
        without it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Uncertainty is a property of decision-making, and a good decision takes
        that into account.
      </p>
      <p>So again,</p>
      <p>W1 → G1<br /></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Bertha notices the clouds and can check the weather forecast. Bertha
          has no way of knowing it will rain until it does, but she errs on the
          side of caution and carries an umbrella with her.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><em>Reponses:</em></p>
      <p>
        Jack: "This kind of assumes that people have consistent/known
        preferences."
      </p>
      <p>
        -- This is a good catch. Yes, this does assume that Bertha has
        consistent preferences throughout the scenario. Maybe she no longer
        cares about her writing goal along W1 to W4.
      </p>

          <p>
            W5 is a bad outcome because it prevents her from completing her
            goal.<a class="footnote" href="#fnref-1">↩</a>
